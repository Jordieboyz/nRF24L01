The n\+R\+F24\+L01 is a small chip which can create a wireless communication between another n\+R\+F24\+L01+ module This can be extremely usefull dor a lot of this where it is more efficient to have a little bit of a distance between arduino\textquotesingle{}s for example\hypertarget{index_Hardware}{}\section{Hardware}\label{index_Hardware}
The n\+R\+F24\+L01+ runs on an Arduino Due, but should also work on other devices as long as the pins used inherit from hwlib\+::pin\+\_\+in and hwlib\+::pin\+\_\+out\hypertarget{index_Usage}{}\section{Usage}\label{index_Usage}
Add the source code directory (n\+R\+F24\+L01+) to your project, and include the header files. This library only works if you use the hwlib library, make sure you use that!
