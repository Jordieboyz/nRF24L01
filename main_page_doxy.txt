/*!  \mainpage nRF24L01+ module
 *  
 *   \section Intro
 *  The nRF24L01 is a small chip which can create a wireless communication between another nRF24L01+ module
 *  This can be extremely usefull dor a lot of this where it is more efficient to have a little bit of a distance between arduino's for example
 *  
 * 
 * 
 *   \section Hardware
 *   The nRF24L01+ runs on an Arduino Due, but should also work on other devices as long as the pins used inherit from hwlib::pin_in and hwlib::pin_out 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 *   \section Usage
 *   Add the source code directory (nRF24L01+) to your project, and include the header files.
 *   This library only works if you use the hwlib library, make sure you use that!
